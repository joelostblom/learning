# Emcee tips

Thank you so much for helping us run one of our calls. Use this guide when you're emceeing a Mozilla Science Lab call!

### Before the call

* Review the agenda - make sure you understand what is going on and how long each section should last for
  * If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to any Mozilla Science staff
* Make sure you have a good internet connection, quiet area and a working webcam (for video calls) to take the call.
* Call in 10-15 min early
  * Speakers will have been asked to call in and test their line 5-10 min early
  * Finalize any last minute details with each of the speakers -- do they want to be introduced in a certain way? Do you know how to pronounce their name?
  * Participants may start arriving shortly before the call. Welcome people as they arrive! Don't worry about constantly repeating yourself.

### Once the call starts

* Open the event! Welcome everyone.

### During the call

Now you can dive into the agenda items. Be gracious and alert as you go through each item. Your job is to be a bridge between each section and not the focal point.

* For each speaker:
  * Introduce each speaker with the same amount of enthusiasm
  * Listen to each speaker and help move into a meaningful discussion with the audience. Encourage questions in the etherpad.
  * Have a couple questions in mind in case the audience doesn't have questions or to give them time to get their questions in the pad
  * Read out any etherpad questions during the discussion
  * Keep an eye on the time! If you're short on time, cut the discussion short. Encourage asnyc etherpad q&a while you move on to the next section.
  
* For each non-verbal section (Friends of Mozilla Science, Community Updates, etc)
  * If the section is at the beginning of the meeting, read through each point on the call
  * If this is at the end of the call, read through if there's time. Otherwise, feel free to skip and encourage listeners to read on their own time.
    * If there's a lot of time left, feel free to turn these into verbal updates if the correct people are on the call

### Closing the call

* Thank everyone! Speakers AND participants.
* Let everyone know when the next call is
